## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a recent graduate with a Master’s degree in **Statistics** from the University of Turin.  
My academic and applied interests include:

- Data Science  
- Bayesian Statistics  
- Factor Analysis  
- Big Data Analytics  

I enjoy statistical modeling, Bayesian inference, computational methods, and reproducible workflows.  
I am currently expanding my open-source portfolio and developing advanced skills in probabilistic modeling and modern data analysis.
